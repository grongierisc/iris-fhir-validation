For example, if the start and end of an ST elevation episode is visible in an EKG, this relation would indicate the ROI bounds the \"ST elevation\" observation -- the ROI defines the true beginning and ending of the episode. Conversely, if a ROI simply contains ST elevation, but it does not define the bounds (start and end) of the episode, the more general \"has support\" relation is used. Likewise, if a ROI on an image defines the true bounds of a \"1st degree burn\", the relation \"has bounded support\" is used; but if the ROI only points to the approximate area of the burn, the general \"has support\" relation is used.","immutable":true,"compose":{"include":[{"system":"http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-ActRelationshipType","filter":[{"property":"concept","op":"is-a","value":"SPRTBND"}]}]}}
