Two parameters a and b are available to adjust the curve. The mean m and variance s2 relate as follows: m = a/ (a + b) and s2 = ab/((a + b)2 (a + b + 1)).</td><td>10756</td><td>active</td></tr><tr><td style=\"white-space:nowrap\">E<a name=\"v3-ProbabilityDistributionType-E\"> </a></td><td>exponential</td><td>Used for data that describes extinction. The exponential distribution is a special form of g-distribution where a = 1, hence, the relationship to mean m and variance s2 are m = b and s2 = b2.</td><td>10752</td><td>active</td></tr><tr><td style=\"white-space:nowrap\">F<a name=\"v3-ProbabilityDistributionType-F\"> </a></td><td>F</td><td>Used to describe the quotient of two c2 random variables. The F-distribution has two parameters n1 and n2, which are the numbers of degrees of freedom of the numerator and denominator variable respectively. The relationship to mean m and variance s2 are: m = n2 / (n2 - 2) and s2 = (2 n2 (n2 + n1 - 2)) / (n1 (n2 - 2)2 (n2 - 4)).</td><td>10755</td><td>active</td></tr><tr><td style=\"white-space:nowrap\">G<a name=\"v3-ProbabilityDistributionType-G\"> </a></td><td>(gamma)</td><td>The gamma-distribution used for data that is skewed and bounded to the right, i.e. where the maximum of the distribution curve is located near the origin. The g-distribution has a two parameters a and b. The relationship to mean m and variance s2 is m = a b and s2 = a b2.</td><td>10751</td><td>active</td></tr><tr><td style=\"white-space:nowrap\">LN<a name=\"v3-ProbabilityDistributionType-LN\"> </a></td><td>log-normal</td><td>The logarithmic normal distribution is used to transform skewed random variable X into a normally distributed random variable U = log X. The log-normal distribution can be specified with the properties mean m and standard deviation s. Note however that mean m and standard deviation s are the parameters of the raw value distribution, not the transformed parameters of the lognormal distribution that are conventionally referred to by the same letters. Those log-normal parameters mlog and slog relate to the mean m and standard deviation s of the data value through slog2 = log (s2/m2 + 1) and mlog = log m - slog2/2.</td><td>10750</td><td>active</td></tr><tr><td style=\"white-space:nowrap\">N<a name=\"v3-ProbabilityDistributionType-N\"> </a></td><td>normal (Gaussian)</td><td>This is the well-known bell-shaped normal distribution. Because of the central limit theorem, the normal distribution is the distribution of choice for an unbounded random variable that is an outcome of a combination of many stochastic processes. Even for values bounded on a single side (i.e. greater than 0) the normal distribution may be accurate enough if the mean is &quot;far away&quot; from the bound of the scale measured in terms of standard deviations.</td><td>10749</td><td>active</td></tr><tr><td style=\"white-space:nowrap\">T<a name=\"v3-ProbabilityDistributionType-T\"> </a></td><td>T</td><td>Used to describe the quotient of a normal random variable and the square root of a c2 random variable. The t-distribution has one parameter n, the number of degrees of freedom.

The width of this interval is 2s sqrt(3). Thus, the uniform distribution assigns the probability densities f(x) = sqrt(2 s sqrt(3)) to values m - s sqrt(3) &gt;= x &lt;= m + s sqrt(3) and f(x) = 0 otherwise.</td><td>10748</td><td>active</td></tr><tr><td style=\"white-space:nowrap\">X2<a name=\"v3-ProbabilityDistributionType-X2\"> </a></td><td>chi square</td><td>Used to describe the sum of squares of random variables which occurs when a variance is estimated (rather than presumed) from the sample. The only parameter of the c2-distribution is n, so called the number of degrees of freedom (which is the number of independent parts in the sum). The c2-distribution is a special type of g-distribution with parameter a = n /2 and b = 2. Hence, m = n and s2 = 2 n.</td><td>10753</td><td>active</td></tr></table></div>"},"url":"http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-ProbabilityDistributionType","identifier":[{"system":"urn:ietf:rfc:3986","value":"urn:oid:2.16.840.1.113883.5.1020"}],"version":"2.1.0","name":"ProbabilityDistributionType","title":"ProbabilityDistributionType","status":"active","experimental":false,"date":"2019-03-20","publisher":"Health Level 7","contact":[{"name":"Health Level Seven"}],"description":"**** MISSING DESCRIPTION ****","caseSensitive":true,"hierarchyMeaning":"is-a","content":"complete","property":[{"extension":[{"url":"http://terminology.hl7.org/StructureDefinition/ext-mif-relationship-symmetry","valueCode":"antisymmetric"},{"url":"http://terminology.hl7.org/StructureDefinition/ext-mif-relationship-transitivity","valueCode":"transitive"},{"url":"http://terminology.hl7.org/StructureDefinition/ext-mif-relationship-reflexivity","valueCode":"irreflexive"},{"url":"http://terminology.hl7.org/StructureDefinition/ext-mif-relationship-isNavigable","valueBoolean":true},{"url":"http://terminology.hl7.org/StructureDefinition/ext-mif-relationship-relationshipKind","valueCode":"Specializes"},{"url":"http://terminology.hl7.org/StructureDefinition/ext-mif-relationship-inverseName","valueString":"Generalizes"}],"code":"Specializes","description":"The child code is a more narrow version of the concept represented by the parent code.
