These observations typically have a logical or practical grouping for generally accepted clinical or functional purposes, such as observations that are run together because of automation. A battery can define required and optional component observations and, in some cases, will define complex rules that determine whether or not a particular observation is made. BATTERY is a constraint on the Observation class in that it is understood to always be composed of component observations.<br/><br/>**UsageNotes:** The focus in a BATTERY is that it is composed of individual observations. In request (RQO) mood, a battery is a request to perform the component observations. In event (EVN) mood a battery is a reporting of associated set of observation events. In definition mood a battery is the definition of the associated set of observations.<br/><br/>**Examples:** Vital signs, Full blood count, Chemistry panel.</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"CodeSystem-v3-ActClass.html#v3-ActClass-CLUSTER\">CLUSTER</a></td><td>Cluster</td><td>**Description:**An ACT that organizes a set of component acts into a semantic grouping that have a shared subject. The subject may be either a subject participation (SBJ), subject act relationship (SUBJ), or child participation/act relationship types.<br/><br/>**Discussion:** The focus in a CLUSTER act is the grouping of the contained acts. For example &quot;a request to cluster&quot; (RQO), &quot;a type of cluster that is allowed to occur&quot; (DEF), etc.<br/><br/>**Examples:** <br/><br/> *  Radiologic investigations that might include administration of a dye, followed by radiographic observations;<br/> *  &quot;Isolate cluster&quot; which includes all testing and specimen processing performed on a specific isolate;<br/> *  a set of actions to perform at a particular stage in a clinical trial.</td></tr></table></li></ul></div>"},"extension":[{"extension":[{"url":"name","valueString":"Name:Class"},{"url":"value","valueString":"DocumentOrganizer"}],"url":"http://terminology.hl7.org/StructureDefinition/ext-mif-assocConceptProp"}],"url":"http://terminology.hl7.org/ValueSet/v3-xActClassDocumentEntryOrganizer","identifier":[{"system":"urn:ietf:rfc:3986","value":"urn:oid:2.16.840.1.113883.1.11.19598"}],"version":"2.0.0","name":"XActClassDocumentEntryOrganizer","title":"x_ActClassDocumentEntryOrganizer","status":"active","experimental":false,"date":"2014-03-26","description":"***No description***","compose":{"include":[{"system":"http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-ActClass","concept":[{"code":"BATTERY"},{"code":"CLUSTER"}]}]}}
