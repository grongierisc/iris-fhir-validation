Therefore, this OpenIssue has been created to declare that it is likely that ActMood.DEF will be &quot;retired&quot; in the future in favor of the more general ActMood.CRT.</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"CodeSystem-v3-ActMood.html#v3-ActMood-EVN\">EVN</a></td><td>event (occurrence)</td><td>**Definition:** An act that actually happens (may be an ongoing act or a documentation of a past act).</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"CodeSystem-v3-ActMood.html#v3-ActMood-EVN.46CRT\">EVN.CRT</a></td><td>event criterion</td><td>***Deprecation Comment:*** This concept This codes should no longer be used.

A risk factor that is present (e.g. obesity, smoking, etc) should be expressed in event mood. INT (intent) reflects a plan for the future, which is a declaration to do something. This contrasts with RSK (risk), which is the potential that something negative will occur that may or may not ever happen. GOL (goal) reflects a hope to achieve something. EXPEC (expectation) is the prediction of a positive or negative event. This contrasts with RSK (risk), which is the potential that something negative will occur that may or may not ever happen, and may not be expected to happen.</td></tr></table></li></ul></div>"},"url":"http://terminology.hl7.org/ValueSet/v3-xClinicalStatementExposureMood","identifier":[{"system":"urn:ietf:rfc:3986","value":"urn:oid:2.16.840.1.113883.1.11.20296"}],"version":"2.0.0","name":"XClinicalStatementExposureMood","title":"x_ClinicalStatementExposureMood","status":"active","experimental":false,"date":"2014-03-26","description":"***No description***","compose":{"include":[{"system":"http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-ActMood","concept":[{"code":"CRT"},{"code":"DEF"},{"code":"EVN"},{"code":"EVN.CRT"},{"code":"RSK"}]}]}}
