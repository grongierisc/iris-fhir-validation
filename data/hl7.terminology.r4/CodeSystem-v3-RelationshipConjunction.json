If XOR criteria occur together with OR and AND criteria, exactly one of the XOR criteria must be true, and at least one of the OR criteria and all AND criteria must be true. In other words, the sets of AND, OR, and XOR criteria are in turn combined by a logical AND operator (all AND criteria and at least one OR criterion and exactly one XOR criterion.) To overcome this ordering, Act criteria can be nested in any way necessary.","caseSensitive":true,"hierarchyMeaning":"is-a","content":"complete","property":[{"extension":[{"url":"http://terminology.hl7.org/StructureDefinition/ext-mif-relationship-symmetry","valueCode":"antisymmetric"},{"url":"http://terminology.hl7.org/StructureDefinition/ext-mif-relationship-transitivity","valueCode":"transitive"},{"url":"http://terminology.hl7.org/StructureDefinition/ext-mif-relationship-reflexivity","valueCode":"irreflexive"},{"url":"http://terminology.hl7.org/StructureDefinition/ext-mif-relationship-isNavigable","valueBoolean":true},{"url":"http://terminology.hl7.org/StructureDefinition/ext-mif-relationship-relationshipKind","valueCode":"Specializes"},{"url":"http://terminology.hl7.org/StructureDefinition/ext-mif-relationship-inverseName","valueString":"Generalizes"}],"code":"Specializes","description":"The child code is a more narrow version of the concept represented by the parent code.
