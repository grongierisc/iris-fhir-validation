ReqSeq is accessible via BLAST, Entrez, and the NCBI FTP site. Information is also available in Entrez Genomes and Entrez Gene, and for some genomes additional information is available in the Map Viewer.\r\n\r\nRefSeq entries can be used with the HL7 coded data type. For example, in the HL7 messages specified according to the HL7 V2 Clinical Genomics Fully LOINC-Qualified Genetic Variation Model, RefSeq entries can be used to as the observation values for genomic reference sequence identifiers (LOINC \\#: 48013-7).\r\n\r\nMore information may be found at: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/RefSeq\r\n\r\nVersioning informaiton: The latest release of RefSeq was released on May 13, 2009 with the release number of 35.\r\n\r\nRefSeq generates new releases roughly every two months.
