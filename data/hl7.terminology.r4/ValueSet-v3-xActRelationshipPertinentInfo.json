The source (cause) is typically an observation, but may be any act, while the target may be any act.<br/><br/>**Examples:**<br/><br/> *  a growth of Staphylococcus aureus may be considered the cause of an abscess<br/> *  contamination of the infusion bag was deemed to be the cause of the infection that the patient experienced<br/> *  lack of staff on the shift was deemed to be a supporting factor (proximal factor) causing the patient safety incident where the patient fell out of bed because the bed-sides had not been put up which caused the night patient to fall out of bed</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"CodeSystem-v3-ActRelationshipType.html#v3-ActRelationshipType-MFST\">MFST</a></td><td>is manifestation of</td><td>An assertion that a new observation may be the manifestation of another existing observation or action. This assumption is attributed to the same actor who asserts the manifestation. This is stronger and more specific than an inverted support link. For example, an agitated appearance can be asserted to be the manifestation (effect) of a known hyperthyroxia. This expresses that one might not have realized a symptom if it would not be a common manifestation of a known condition. The target (cause) may be any service, while the source (manifestation) must be an observation.</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"CodeSystem-v3-ActRelationshipType.html#v3-ActRelationshipType-REFR\">REFR</a></td><td>refers to</td><td>A relationship in which the target act is referred to by the source act. This permits a simple reference relationship that distinguishes between the referent and the referee.</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"CodeSystem-v3-ActRelationshipType.html#v3-ActRelationshipType-SPRT\">SPRT</a></td><td>has support</td><td>Used to indicate that an existing service is suggesting evidence for a new observation. The assumption of support is attributed to the same actor who asserts the observation. Source must be an observation, target may be any service (e.g., to indicate a status post).</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"CodeSystem-v3-ActRelationshipType.html#v3-ActRelationshipType-SUBJ\">SUBJ</a></td><td>has subject</td><td>Relates an Act to its subject Act that the first Act is primarily concerned with.<br/><br/>Examples<br/><br/>1.  The first Act may be a ControlAct manipulating the subject Act<br/>2.  The first act is a region of interest (ROI) that defines a region within the subject Act.<br/>3.  The first act is a reporting or notification Act, that echos the subject Act for a specific new purpose.<br/><br/>Constraints<br/><br/>An Act may have multiple subject acts.<br/><br/>Rationale<br/><br/>The ActRelationshipType &quot;has subject&quot; is similar to the ParticipationType &quot;subject&quot;, Acts that primarily operate on physical subjects use the Participation, those Acts that primarily operate on other Acts (other information) use the ActRelationship.</td></tr></table></li></ul></div>"},"extension":[{"extension":[{"url":"name","valueString":"Name:Act:inboundRelationship:ActRelationship"},{"url":"value","valueString":"pertainsTo"}],"url":"http://terminology.hl7.org/StructureDefinition/ext-mif-assocConceptProp"},{"extension":[{"url":"name","valueString":"Name:Act:outboundRelationship:ActRelationship"},{"url":"value","valueString":"pertinentInformation"}],"url":"http://terminology.hl7.org/StructureDefinition/ext-mif-assocConceptProp"},{"extension":[{"url":"name","valueString":"Sort:Act:inboundRelationship:ActRelationship"},{"url":"value","valueString":"DA_______"}],"url":"http://terminology.hl7.org/StructureDefinition/ext-mif-assocConceptProp"},{"extension":[{"url":"name","valueString":"Sort:Act:outboundRelationship:ActRelationship"},{"url":"value","valueString":"DA_______"}],"url":"http://terminology.hl7.org/StructureDefinition/ext-mif-assocConceptProp"}],"url":"http://terminology.hl7.org/ValueSet/v3-xActRelationshipPertinentInfo","identifier":[{"system":"urn:ietf:rfc:3986","value":"urn:oid:2.16.840.1.113883.1.11.19562"}],"version":"2.0.0","name":"XActRelationshipPertinentInfo","title":"x_ActRelationshipPertinentInfo","status":"active","experimental":false,"date":"2014-03-26","description":"***No description***","compose":{"include":[{"system":"http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-ActRelationshipType","concept":[{"code":"CAUS"},{"code":"MFST"},{"code":"REFR"},{"code":"SPRT"},{"code":"SUBJ"}]}]}}
