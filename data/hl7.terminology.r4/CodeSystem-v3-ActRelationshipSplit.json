An action plan is a composite Act with component Acts. In a sequential plan, each component has a sequenceNumber that specifies the ordering of the plan steps. Branches exist when multiple components have the same sequenceNumber. The splitCode specifies whether a branch is executed exclusively (case-switch) or inclusively, i.e., in parallel with other branches.\r\n\r\nIn addition to exlusive and inclusive split the splitCode specifies how the pre-condition (also known as \"guard conditions\" on the branch) are evaluated. A guard condition may be evaluated once when the branching step is entered and if the conditions do not hold at that time, the branch is abandoned. Conversely execution of a branch may wait until the guard condition turns true.\r\n\r\nIn exclusive wait branches, the first branch whose guard conditions turn true will be executed and all other branches abandoned. In inclusive wait branches some branches may already be executed while other branches still wait for their guard conditions to turn true.","caseSensitive":true,"hierarchyMeaning":"is-a","content":"complete","property":[{"extension":[{"url":"http://terminology.hl7.org/StructureDefinition/ext-mif-relationship-symmetry","valueCode":"antisymmetric"},{"url":"http://terminology.hl7.org/StructureDefinition/ext-mif-relationship-transitivity","valueCode":"transitive"},{"url":"http://terminology.hl7.org/StructureDefinition/ext-mif-relationship-reflexivity","valueCode":"irreflexive"},{"url":"http://terminology.hl7.org/StructureDefinition/ext-mif-relationship-isNavigable","valueBoolean":true},{"url":"http://terminology.hl7.org/StructureDefinition/ext-mif-relationship-relationshipKind","valueCode":"Specializes"},{"url":"http://terminology.hl7.org/StructureDefinition/ext-mif-relationship-inverseName","valueString":"Generalizes"}],"code":"Specializes","description":"The child code is a more narrow version of the concept represented by the parent code.
