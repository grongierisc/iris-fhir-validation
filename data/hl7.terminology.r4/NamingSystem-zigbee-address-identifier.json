The most-significant 24 bits of the ZigBee address is the so-called Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI). It can be used to determine the manufacturer of a device. OUI prefixes are assigned by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). An EUI (Extended Unique Identifier) is generally made from an OUI and thus a ZigBee Address is also an EUI-64. When a ZigBee device joins a network it is assigned an additional 16-bit address sometimes referred to as its network address.
