All workers are classified into one of over 820 occupations according to their occupational definition. To facilitate classification, occupations are combined to form 23 major groups, 96 minor groups, and 449 broad occupations. Each broad occupation includes detailed occupation(s) requiring similar job duties, skills, education, or experience. This code system replaced the older FIPSPUB92, which was withdrawn in February 2005.","caseSensitive":true,"content":"not-present"}
