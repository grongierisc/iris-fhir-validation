However, CUI does not include classified information (see definition above) or information a non-executive branch entity possesses and maintains in its own systems that did not come from, or was not created or possessed by or for, an executive branch agency or an entity acting for an agency. Law, regulation, or Government-wide policy may require or permit safeguarding or dissemination controls in three ways: Requiring or permitting agencies to control or protect the information but providing no specific controls, which makes the information CUI Basic; requiring or permitting agencies to control or protect the information and providing specific controls for doing so, which makes the information CUI Specified; or requiring or permitting agencies to control the information and specifying only some of those controls, which makes the information CUI Specified, but with CUI Basic controls where the authority does not specify. Based on CUI Glossary https://www.archives.gov/cui/registry/cui-glossary.html .<br/><br/>*Usage Note:* Mandatory control marking, which must be displayed on the top portion of each rendered or printed page containing controlled information. Should be displayed at the bottom of each rendered or printed page containing controlled information. Must be displayed on each portion of controlled information at the portion level if portions are uncontrolled unclassified information.
