The documentation is supported by databases: Country/Collection Facility, Product Code (blood components), Product Code (hematopoietic progenitor sells), Product Code (source plasma), Product Code (tissues) and Special Testing. ISBT 128 is designed as a series of data structures that are designed to be technology-independent and can be used for bar coding, radio frequency tag encoding and electronic data interchange.
